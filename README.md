# Mobile Car User Interface

## Assumptions Made

1. Used a professional and clean UI theme to be appealing to the target customer demographic.
2. Reduced the number of steps and screens to get to final booking process to improve conversion and customer experience.
3. Allowed customer to use some, all, or no filters so they can broaden or narrow scope as they wish.
4. Used typechecking with TypeScript to reduce runtime errors in development.
5. Hard coded make and color filters rather than using API data because it's unlikely that data will ever change.
